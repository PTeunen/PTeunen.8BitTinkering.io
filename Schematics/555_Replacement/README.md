As everyone from the 2020's started following BenEater youtube channel, The electronics-bug got me again heavily. 

I didn't wanted to rely on the 555 setup like he described in his video's:
* Timer module is one for debugging and will be exchanged in the final version by a fixed oscillator,
* 555-module electronics is known by me and good elaborate info already exists on the net.
* I wanted to learn more about AVR's also! :)

Heavily relies on the setup made by "steveggoyette" (https://github.com/stevegg/beneater_arduino_clock), but I exchanged its Arduino in the design by a Attiny85.
